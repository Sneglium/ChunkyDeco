# ChunkyDeco

### A collection of simplistic, "chunky" 3D decoration nodes for Minetest Game.

## Overview

ChunkyDeco adds a large number of decorative nodes, many of which have complicated recipes. In order to view all the recipes and make crafting them easier, an inventory mod like Unified Inventory or I3 is recommended.

The Et Cetera library mod is required, as well as a number of mods provided by Minetest Game.

## Help

### How do I get colored variants of decorations?
ChunkyDeco uses dynamic coloring in order to avoid creating tons of versions of every node, which unfortunately means they can't be listed separately in the 'creative' menu or recipe list of any mod. In order to obtain colorful versions of furniture, flowerpots, and so on you can craft the base version with dye, and optionally add a "Color Rendering Catalyst" to create a much brighter more vibrant version.

### Some fixtures aren't placing down how I want them to!
Et Cetera provides a system for node rotation that automatically copies the rotation of the node you were just looking at if they are of the same type. You can prevent this behaviour by sneaking while placing.
